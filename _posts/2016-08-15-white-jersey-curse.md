For this article, i'm going to want to look into these articles/sites, and potentially more:

-2015 WSJ article on oregon jersey curse: [http://www.wsj.com/articles/if-the-oregon-ducks-lose-blame-the-pants-1420833281](http://www.wsj.com/articles/if-the-oregon-ducks-lose-blame-the-pants-1420833281)

-SI article on the same thing (more op-ed than data analysis): [http://www.si.com/extra-mustard/2015/01/09/why-oregons-new-uniforms-mean-theyre-going-lose-championship](http://www.si.com/extra-mustard/2015/01/09/why-oregons-new-uniforms-mean-theyre-going-lose-championship)

-uniwatch probably has some good stuff: [http://www.uni-watch.com/](http://www.uni-watch.com/)
